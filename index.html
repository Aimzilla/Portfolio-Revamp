            <h2>A little about me...</h2>
              <div class="half-width">
                <p>My journey into tech started with an undergraduate degree in Sociology and Psychology, as well as a Master's degree in Business.
                   After 20 years of working in various roles in the insurance industry, I chucked it all, and joined the Peace Corps
                   where I served in Namibia.  While there, I became aware of just how much technology was used around the world, and realized
                     what a valuable tool to teach finances, health, and language.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="half-width">
                <p>It was then that I decided that upon
                  my return to the U.S. that I wanted to go into tech.
                  After taking several courses online and attending a coding bootcamp, I decided that I am most
                  interested in website development and front-end code of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I hope to use my
                  new skills coupled with my pre-existing skillset to work for non-profits and marginalized
                  communities writing clean, elegant, and accessible code.

              <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
              <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 to
                make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate on,
                easy to trouble-shoot and is accessible to all users.</p>

              <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
              <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.
                I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I try
                to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                convert it into a webpage that is a pixel-perfect match.</p>
